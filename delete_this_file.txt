# 📍 Urban Green Space Accessibility Analysis

## 🔍 Objective
To assess how accessible public parks are to residents in a selected urban area, using a 10-minute walking distance as the threshold for equitable green space access.

## 🧰 Tools & Techniques Used
- ArcGIS Pro
- Spatial analysis: Buffer tool, Selaect Layer By Location
- Symbology and labeling
- Map layout creation and export

## 📊 Data Sources
- Parks: Local GIS open data portal or OpenStreetMap
- Population: U.S. Census Block Groups (TIGER/Line)
- Streets (for context): OpenStreetMap basemap

## 📌 Key Steps
1. Imported park polygons and population blocks into ArcGIS Pro
2. Created 800-meter (approx. 10-minute walk) buffers around each park
3. Selected block groups intersecting park buffers
4. Symbolized population served vs. underserved
5. Exported a final map layout for presentation

## 🖼️ Output
- `Urban_Green_Space_Accessibility.pdf`: Map showing park buffers and underserved zones
- `green_space_accessibility_layout.png`: Screenshot of ArcGIS Pro layout
- Summary table of served vs. unserved population (optional)

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated
- Buffer analysis
- Spatial query and selection
- Attribute joining and labeling
- Communicating findings visually through map design
