# 📍 Environmental Justice Web Map

## 🔍 Objective
To create an interactive web map that visualizes key environmental justice indicators, such as pollution exposure, income level, and population vulnerability across a defined region (e.g., Colorado).

## 🧰 Tools & Techniques Used
- ArcGIS Online (AGOL)
- Hosted feature layers
- Smart mapping & symbology
- Pop-up configuration and layer styling
- Public web map publishing

## 📊 Data Sources
- EPA EJScreen or local environmental data
- U.S. Census demographic layers (income, race, age)
- Esri Living Atlas basemaps

## 📌 Key Steps
1. Added environmental and demographic layers to a new AGOL map
2. Styled layers with color ramps to reflect variable intensity (e.g., PM2.5, percent low-income)
3. Configured pop-ups for contextual detail on hover/click
4. Set up legend, basemap, and scale visibility
5. Published as a public map with shareable link

## 🖼️ Output
- [**Live Map Link**](#) *(replace this with your AGOL URL)*
- Screenshot of the map with legend and pop-ups visible
- JSON or layer item ID (optional advanced)

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated
- Web GIS publishing using AGOL
- Thematic cartography (choropleth, transparency)
- Designing for interactivity and accessibility
- Communicating complex spatial data to non-GIS audiences
