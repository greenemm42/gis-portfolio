# 📍 Land Use Change Analysis (2000–2020)

## 🔍 Objective
To compare land use patterns between two time periods (e.g., 2000 and 2020) and identify areas of significant change using spatial overlay and geoprocessing tools in ArcGIS Pro.

## 🧰 Tools & Techniques Used
- ArcGIS Pro
- Geoprocessing tools: Clip, Intersect, Union, Spatial Join
- Symbology and classification
- Attribute table comparison

## 📊 Data Sources
- Land use shapefiles or rasters from 2000 and 2020 (e.g., NLCD, local planning departments)
- Base map for context (Esri, OpenStreetMap)

## 📌 Key Steps
1. Acquired and preprocessed land use data from two different years
2. Projected datasets into a common coordinate system
3. Performed spatial overlay (e.g., Intersect or Union)
4. Calculated and visualized where land use types changed
5. Symbolized areas by category of change (e.g., Forest → Urban)

## 🖼️ Output
- Final map layout showing land use changes (PDF or image)
- Screenshot of attribute table or geoprocessing model
- (Optional) Summary table with acre/square mile changes by type

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated
- Time-based spatial analysis
- Overlay geoprocessing
- Interpretation of land classification codes
- Communicating spatial change with cartography
